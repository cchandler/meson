H1. About
Core routing system in the mson architecture.  It's very much unpolished and very much not ready for general release :-).

H2. Dependencies
* RabbitMQ AMQP Erlang client
* erlang_couchdb

H2. Goals
I plan on packing this as a proper OTP application soon.

H2. Thanks
To ngerakines for making the erlang_couchdb module.  It made my life much, much easier.
